title: Rebooting the blog
---

Back in 2016, I made a [new year's resolution]({% post_url 2016-01-09-new-years-resolution %})
to write at least one blog post a month. Like many resolutions it didn't see out the year, stalling
in August. In the 4 years since, this blog has remained neglected. In that period of time, I have
changed job, changed country and added a couple of children, so the lack of activity perhaps somewhat understandable.
At any rate, I have resolved to start blogging again, but without setting specific
targets which can only lead to disappointment when they're not met.
