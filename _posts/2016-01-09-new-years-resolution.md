title: New Year's Resolution
---

I've been trying for a while to find the time and energy to start blogging about
programming and computing topics which are interesting, but never quite managed
to get it off the ground.

I've been inspired by [Martin Odersky's post](http://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2016/01/02/new-year-resolutions.html) to
use the turning of the year as an incentive. If it's good enough for him,
then certainly it is good enough for me.I'm resolving to write (at least)
one post per month. And this doesn't count as January's!

The topics will likely be from issues encountered during my professional activities
(expect to see Scala and Akka programming, and Hadoop related things) and also
hobby interests (Docker, Raspberry Pi, maybe even Lego robots).

Since a lack of posts will inevitably mean a lack of readers, I'll have to hold
myself to account on this resolution, at least to start with.

Happy New Year.
