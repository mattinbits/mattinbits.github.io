I am a software engineer currently specializing in Scala development
(including Akka and Spark) and Big Data solutions based on the Hadoop eco-system.
I also have experience programming in Java and Python, and using Docker
to package and deliver software.

I am currently self employed as a contractor in the UK, and I am
interested in contract and permanent opportunities in the Manchester area,
or exciting permanent opportunities which offer a chance to work abroad.

I am interested in and have experience with a wide range of computing
related topics, beyond those I currently focus on professionally, and my I
always relish the opportunity to learn something new.

Outside of the endlessly fascinating realm of computing, I am a keen amateur
pianist and rugby player.
