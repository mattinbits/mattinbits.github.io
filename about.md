I am a senior engineer with experience in Scala development
(including Akka and Spark), Python development, and many other programming languages and tools.
I have experience with application engineering and data engineering.
I am enthusiastic about developing and migrating applications to run in a cloud-native environment.
I believe mentoring other team members, and learning from them in return, is one of the most
valuable things an engineer can do.

I am interested in and have experience with a wide range of computing
related topics, beyond those I currently focus on professionally, and  I
always relish the opportunity to learn something new.

Outside of the endlessly fascinating realm of computing, I am a keen amateur
pianist and rugby player.
