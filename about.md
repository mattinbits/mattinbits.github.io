I am an Engineering leader with experience in Data & Analytics, Cloud Native platforms, and general software development. I am enthusiastic about developing and migrating applications to run in a cloud-native environment.
I believe that mentoring others, and learning from them in return, is one of the most
valuable things an engineer can do.

I am interested in and have experience with a wide range of computing
related topics, beyond those I currently focus on professionally, and I
always relish the opportunity to learn something new.
